# Polyphonic-Acoustic-Event-Detection
Polyphonic Sound event localization and detection (SELD) is the combined task of identifying the temporal onset and offset of a sound event, tracking the spatial location when active, and further associating a textual label describing the sound event. TAU Spatial Sound Events 2019 dataset is used in this project
